# Novel Role Filler Generalization for Recurrent Neural Networks Using Working Memory-Based Indirection
* `/data` - Contains all of the sets of words and outputs from runnin the scripts and models
* `/scripts` - Contains all of the scripts used to generate the output.

### Workflow
There are several bash scripts in the `/scripts` folder that will help you work with the python programs to generate and test data. Here is a summary on what each one does and in what order they should be used.


## There are a couple different models:
* `e2e_enc_dec.py` - 
* `e2e_enc_dec_query.py` -
* `indirection_model.py` - 
* `indirection_model_w_enc-dec.py` - 
* `nested-enc-dec-query.py` -
* `nested-enc-dec.py` -
