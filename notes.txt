- Working on the query part



-----------------------------------------------
-- Notes on Mike's Code                      --
-----------------------------------------------
He did 200 task blocks
a task block is 200 times
block accuracy is block_tasks_correct / 200

Querying is done by a random selection

correct trial on line 505

block task correct if it get's the whole sequence correct
	(line 513)

loops until greater than 95 percent accuracy

Taks Complete:
Block Accuracy:

Final Block Accuracy:                <-- block_tasks_correct/200 *100
Generalization Accuracy:             <-- This is the test set
