I'm having to use expand dims on the hrr's, am I doing that properly?
--> I'm looking at that now. He said something about surrounding it with brackets.
I need to look at my notes about that when I get home.











- Working on the query part
The three models stay the same over all time steps
the previous time steps input is trained with the output of the current
time step

need to store things in wm slots during training

-- Notes on Mike's Code                      --
-----------------------------------------------
He did 200 task blocks
a task block is 200 times
block accuracy is block_tasks_correct / 200

Querying is done by a random selection

correct trial on line 505

block task correct if it get's the whole sequence correct
	(line 513)

loops until greater than 95 percent accuracy

Taks Complete:
Block Accuracy:

Final Block Accuracy:                <-- block_tasks_correct/200 *100
Generalization Accuracy:             <-- This is the test set
