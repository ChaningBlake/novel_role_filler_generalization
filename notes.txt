Trained up encoder-decoder with mikes code. That was with 5 letter words.

When I trained up the encoder decoder on the large data set, 


-------------------------------------------
can put none in for the length
data still needs to have a fixed shape, but the models will adapt to input
100,000 word corpus
regularization methods - any attempt to make the model generalize better -> covering up a letter
maybe add a dropout layer
batch size - 32
DO Mike's first

DISCUSSION - we could use other models for the words
    word to vec
    bert models
    
Abstraction needs less data

1. testSentences.r

3. splitFiles.sh
4. ./word-enc-dec.py trainset testset 6

-- Notes on Mike's Code                      --
-----------------------------------------------
He did 200 task blocks
a task block is 200 times
block accuracy is block_tasks_correct / 200

Querying is done by a random selection

correct trial on line 505

block task correct if it get's the whole sequence correct
	(line 513)

loops until greater than 95 percent accuracy

Taks Complete:
Block Accuracy:

Final Block Accuracy:                <-- block_tasks_correct/200 *100
Generalization Accuracy:             <-- This is the test set
